If we want to create blank repositry than we use "git init" .

If we want to work on a existing project than use "git clone <URL>" .

If we want to check any changes are made in our files than we have to use "git status" on the partcular file location.

If we want to check what changes are made than we have to use "git diff <FileName>".

We can only commit a staged area file
so we have to use "git add <file name>" .

If we want to check that what changes are made previously then we should use "git log"

If we want to check only last n number of commit than we should use "git log -n" .

------------------------------------------------------------------
*) When we're using "git log" then it'll show all the commits done before the command pushed then you'll face a problem that's it'll show huge commited items,just to get rid of from that press "q+enter"  .
------------------------------------------------------------------

To check current branch write the command "git branch" .

To create a new Branch write down the command "git checkout -b <newBranchName>" .

To switch a branch write this command "git checkout <BranchName>" .

To delete a branch , At first go to the location where the particullar branch is located then write "git branch -d <BranchName>" .


When we try to add branch with master branch than write "git merge master" .

Undo the latest change then write "git reset --hard HEAD" .
