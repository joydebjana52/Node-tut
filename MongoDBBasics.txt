*) "mongo" is replaced by "mongosh" .

*) MongoDB Compass is a GUI tool.


MongoDB Points:--
1.) MongoDB is a NoSQL database.
	==> Oracle,MySQL,SQL Server is "Structured Query Language" means they have query to find some data .
2.) The data stored in a collection
3.) Collection don't have row and columns
4.) Data is stored in the form of Object.

*) Create DB using Command :--
	use "nameOfDB"
after that you'll not able to see dataBase just bcx you haven;t created any collection and for this write the command :- db.createCollection('collectionsName');

To check collections:- show collections;

To drop a collection:- db.collectionName.drop(); // drop() is a funcion...

To delete Database:- 
	1.) use 'dbName"
	2.) db.dropDatebase();	// it's also a method

____________________________________________________


Basic CRUD operation in MongoDB:--

------------
| C-Create |
| R-Read   |_______________.
| U-Update |_______________.
| D-Delete |
------------

Check inserted data:--
	1.) First Go to the desired db.
	2.) Then write db.collectionName.find() .


If we want to update data of a particular document than write this command:--

	==> db.collectionName.updateOne({name:"nameValue"},{$set:{brand:"mi"}});

To delete a particular document from a collection:-
db.product.deleteOne({name:"apple"});



**) SQL v/s MongoDB :-
SQL stores data in form of Table in other hand MongoDB stores data in form of Object.

____________________________________________________
const dbConnect = require('./mongodb');
const deleteData = async()=>{
    let data = await dbConnect();
    const result = await data.deleteMany({name:'narzo 10'});

    if(result.acknowledged)
    {
        console.log(result.acknowledged);
    }
};
deleteData();
____________________________________________________
if we want to delete a data which wasn't present in Database than we can't only confirming this by result.acknowledged we have to consider result.deletedCount also .If the value of deletedCount=0 that means the data wasn't present in your Database .
