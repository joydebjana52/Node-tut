API -> Application Programming Interface .

API -> A set of program that allows to interact with other software/program .

Points to be remembered:--
    1.) API is a tool for sharing data in applications.
        ==> It may be between two software or software and program 
    2.) Share data between platformds.
        ==> Like data interchange between Front-end & Back-end.
    3.) Share Data from between programming language.
        ==> Let's assume that you have written some program in Java,some in C++,some in Python,Now you want to combine them,than API is also used.

*) Without API you can't share data because one's code can't be understandalbe by another code Without API.

There are several kinds of API method exist in API community but mostly 4 of them are oftenly used.They are:--
    1.) GET     --> It's used to get data from Database.
    2.) POST    --> It's used to save data in Database.
    3.) PUT     --> It's used to update data in Database.
    4.) DELETE  --> It's used to delete data from Database.

Q.1) Can we pass "body" in GET method ?
==> No. We can pass "query" 

POST API method ---
==> When we want to save/store some new data through API, then POST method is used.


Q.2) Can we set the same route for both 'get' and 'post' method ?
==> Yes. 


Q.3) "app.use(express.json())" is used instead of using "body-parser" .

*) If we want to update some data of a database then we should use "PUT" method of API.
 
Q.4) Now one question may arise in your mind that can we update data using "POST" method ?
==> Yes, ofcourse .But you are recommended to use "PUT" method When you want to update some data.remember that
    we can apply one particular method for many task but this may not be standard for the task.

*) We can access data through "req.params.name" for "PUT" method .

*) we can't select an item by writing "id" , we have to write "_id" .
Secnodly, this "_id" is an Object so before using it we have to create an instaence of this Object by following the below syntax :--
    {_id : new mongodb.ObjectId(req.params.id)}
