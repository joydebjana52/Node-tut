Almost every-task in Node.JS is performed Event-based.It's important topic.

Events is used in almost every language. Like we have already used them escpecially in HTML,JavaScript.

*) Event :-> we can understand "Event" that is nothing but a singnal by using we do perform some task.
*) Event-emitter :->This is a Class/Module that provides events, knows as Event-emitter.

Q.1) If anyone asks you about creating a button through Node.JS 
==> Then reply will be,through API.Beacuse normally buttons are part of Browser.

*) Syntax of importing a Module 
=> const EventEmitter = require('events);
Now question is why we are writting "E" capital of EventEmitter ?
==> Basically "EventEmitter" is a Class that's why.It'a standard way.
